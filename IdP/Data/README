Implementations or repositories go here.
Never import this code into domain and application services, use dependency injection instead so that the data storage
implementations can be swapped.
Dont put application logic here, Remember that repositories can not contain application logic, only CRUD+Quary methods

For the first iteration of the API i use in memory mocks of the repositories to focus on teh code and avoid waisting
time on database setup, this mocks will also be useful in unit testing.
